Hi There , It's a Simple MongoDB System on Which User Login From Username : ADJ , Password : abc123 That is present in func 

After login uuser will see two buttons 
           1:- Fetch : To Get All Cars data from backend DataBase that is MongoDB connected using Node JS API
           2:- Insert : From this button user can add new Cars data into Existing data when button ( Save ) is Tapped

Mainly it's a main practice for Xcode iOS app to connect with DB using Node API
